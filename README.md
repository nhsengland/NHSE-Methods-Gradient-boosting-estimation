## NHSEI Methods: Gradient boosting estimation


### About this method

Gradient boosting statistical analysis method is a machine learning methodology which uses a decision tree approach to take into account relationships between variables and outcome to generate coefficients/weights.


### Requirements

Installation of R and Alteryx package: "gbm"


### Summary of the code

This code is developing the weights for each variables using R software. The code reads and prepares the data and then constructs the command string. Then it defines the type of target / distribution of the loss function and determines the preferred number of trees in the model, as well as further model specifications. 
When the model is run, it creates a list with the model objects and it writes out the results. Finally, it creates and exports a few plots.
